    <p>Tropical Storm Vicente was a small tropical cyclone that made landfall as a tropical depression in the Mexican
        state of Michoac√°n on October 23, 2018, causing deadly mudslides. The 21st named storm of the 2018 Pacific
        hurricane season, it originated from a tropical wave that traveled westward from Africa's western coast across
        the Atlantic and entered the Eastern Pacific on October 17. The disturbance formed into a tropical depression
        early on October 19 and became Tropical Storm Vicente later that day. It peaked on October 20 with winds of 50
        mph (85 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,002 mbar (29.59 inHg).</p>
